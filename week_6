# Week 6: Beginning of Project 2 in a group

## Git Worklow:

Representation of a sequence of tasks or operations performed by a person, a group of persons, an organization, etc. The term flow refers to the passage of the product, document, information, etc., from one stage to another.
The master and dev branches should not be changed because they represent the stable product, and protecting them avoids conflicts. For this a branch including the USER Stories must be drawn from dev.
When the US is finished it is possible to make a pull request on dev which will allow the Product Owner to test the product.
If the latter finds bugs he can note them in issues on github and the developer can find them.

## Initiation to Scrum Method:

### Discover the Agile method with the manifesto:

-   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
-   Working software over comprehensive documentation
-   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
-   Responding to change over following a plan

###  What is Scrum Method:

Scrum is simple.  It is the opposite of a big collection of interwoven mandatory components. Scrum is not a methodology. 
Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, 
with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems.  


###  How does it work:

The below graphic represents Scrum in Action:  it's a simple overview of viewers learning about the roles, artifacts and events and how they 
coming together to deliver a product to market.
