THE WORKFLOW

A **workflow** consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity.
About our activity we tried few of them.

1) To begin, we decide to use **the pair programming**. It consists to share the same computer in a given time (10 minutes for each one) to create code. 

	- Pros: 
		- conflicts happened before we write the code. So no conflicts on pull requests.
		- it's a good way to learn other coding styles and tricks.
	- Cons:
		- it's a waste of time in term of productivity.

2) After it, we decide to work on the same branch but each one of us using his computer.
	- Pros: 
		- better comfort for us because it's our computer.
		- we don't have to wait for team mates.
	- Cons:
		- lot of conflicts to resolve each time we push.
		- risk to loose your progress.

3) To finish, we try to create different branches for each feature.
	- Pros: 
	 	- same pros as before.
		- we always have a stable version of the project.
		- no push conflict, only one when we merge.
		- when pull request, the team mates have to validate the new code.
	- Cons:
		- it's difficult to understand and to set for a beginner.

To conclude, each one can prefer his workflow, but we don't recommend the second one. 
We've got only problems with it, and no pros.
