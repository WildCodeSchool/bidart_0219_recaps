**OOP**: Object-oriented programming / **

**What is it and what's the concept**:

 - The basis for OOP started in the early 1960s, 
 - 
  - Object-oriented (OO) programming is a programming **paradigm** that
   includes or relies on the concept of **objects,** **encapsulated data
   structures** that have properties and functions and which interact
   with other objects.
   
   -In the class-based **object-oriented** programming paradigm, **object
   refers to a particular instance of a class** where the object can be
   a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
   
  - A good understanding of OOPs' concept **can help in *decision
   making*** when designing an application.  Objects in a program
   frequently represent **real-world** object, That' why we are writing
   coding ,to solve our real world problem right.


**How to use it:**:

 **Object:** It’s the instance of a class/ it’s the working entity of a class. ####
  **Class:** It is a template or blue print about the capability of what an object can do. #### 
  **Method:** The behaviours of a class. It tells what a method can do. #### 
  **Instance:**  Object and Instance both are same with small difference.  Instance is an object that has been created and exists in memory.

**Short Conclusion for OOP:**
1. EverythingIsAnObject 
2. Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages (in terms of objects). 
3. Objects have their own memory (in terms of objects). 
4. Every object is an instance of a class (which must be an object).*

**ES6**: EcmaScript 6

**What is it and how to use it **:
EcmaScript is not any scripting language instead a standard that Javascript is based upon. 
So, ES6 is a new version or new standard of Javascript.
ES6 brings many new feature like concept of **classes**, **template tags**, **arrow functions** etc.
