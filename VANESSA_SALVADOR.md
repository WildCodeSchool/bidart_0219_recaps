# Loops:

There are different types of loops, but they all do essentially the same thing: repeat an action a number of times. The different loops also offer different ways to determine their starting and ending points.

The sentences for loops available in JavaScript are:

- **FOR** : A for loop is repeated until the specified condition is evaluated as false.

		for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) {
			 statement;
		}
	
- **WHILE** : A while sentence executes its sentences as long as the condition is evaluated as true. If the condition changes to false, the statement inside the loop stops executing and the control switches to the statement immediately after the loop.


          while (condition) {
			  statement;
		 }
- **DO...WHILE** : The sentence do...while is repeated until a specified condition is evaluated as false. Unlike while, here the sentence is executed before the condition is evaluated.

		 do {
			 statement;
		  } while (condition);
